# Student-Formula-Report
This repository contains the report, and the code I developed to perform statistical analysis on the Bengal 2023. This is a document to keep track of the Bengal Data Analysis. The purpose of this is to keep track of my analysis and also showcase what I have done, and gathering what I have learnt from the data set.
